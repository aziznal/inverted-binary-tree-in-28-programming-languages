### Challenges

- dynamic arrays are not a given
- wait was it `*` or `&`
- I may have achieved the world record for segfault any%
- figuring out the size of an array is an ordeal.
- high-level language devs are pampered babies (me included)
- `malloc` scares me
- rust is easy, actually.
- recursion is easier in C than in rust, and by easier, I mean the compiler doesn't scream in my face telling me why I should probably not be doing it.
