# 10-zig

```bash
zig run main.zig
```

### Notes
- Does not play nice with docker. I just want the goddamn toolchain, the `zig` command, my dude.
- `?*` is not the same as `*?`, obviously.
- segmentation faults still instill a visceral fear in me.
- we have both `null` and `undefined`. `null` is nothing, `undefined` is an eventual seg fault.
- this felt eerily like rust, though harder in some places and more difficult in others
